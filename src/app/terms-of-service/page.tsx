        <p>The use of this website, including the submission of information through forms or other means, does not create an attorney-client relationship between you and Lex Claim Connect or any of its affiliated attorneys or law firms. An attorney-client relationship is only formed when there is an explicit agreement between you and a specific attorney or law firm to represent you.</p>
        <p>Information submitted through this website will be shared with third-party attorneys who participate in our network. We do not guarantee that any attorney will agree to represent you or that your case will qualify for legal representation.</p>

        <p>The case evaluation we provide is preliminary and based on the limited information you provide. It is not a substitute for a comprehensive legal analysis by a qualified attorney who has been formally retained to represent you. We make no guarantees about the outcome of any case or the amount of any potential settlement or verdict.</p>

        <p>Our Service allows you to post, link, store, share and otherwise make available certain information, text, graphics, videos, or other material. You are responsible for the content you post on or through the Service.</p>
        <p>By posting content on or through the Service, you represent and warrant that the content is accurate and not misleading, does not violate the rights of any third party, and complies with all applicable laws.</p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">6. Accuracy of Information</h2>
        <p>While we strive to provide accurate information about mass tort cases and legal issues, we cannot guarantee the accuracy, completeness, or timeliness of the information on our website. Legal information can change rapidly, and case eligibility criteria may be updated as litigation progresses.</p>
        <p>The information provided on this website is for general informational purposes only and should not be relied upon as legal advice for your specific situation.</p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">7. Third-Party Referrals</h2>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">8. Links To Other Web Sites</h2>
        <p>Our Service may contain links to third-party web sites or services that are not owned or controlled by Lex Claim Connect. We have no control over, and assume no responsibility for, the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party web sites or services.</p>
